# gbc-census

A census of GBC devices. This data was manually scraped over a few years.
Currently the dataset is biased towards the UK.

The data is sorted by serial number and split by prefix:
- `C` series: Made in Japan, distributed in Japan and internationally ([here](gbc-census-C.csv)).
- `CG` series: Made in Japan and China for North America ([here](gbc-census-CG.csv)).
- `CH` series: Made in China, distributed internationally ([here](gbc-census-CH.csv)).
- `X` series: Promotional units ([here](gbc-census-X.csv)).
