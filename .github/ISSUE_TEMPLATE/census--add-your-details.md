- [ ] **Back photo**: Attach a photo clearly showing the serial number (e.g. `CH1245678`) and also the model number (e.g. `C/CGB-EUR`) on the larger rear sticker.
- [ ] **PCB photo**: Attach photo(s) to show the revision number (e.g. `05`) and PCB panel numbers (e.g. `1-2`), under the battery terminal on the lower left side. This can be seen, simply by opening the battery cover and tilting the unit, but can be tricky to photograph.
- [ ] **Special edition photos** (optional): If your unit is a Special Edition, include extra photographs that show the front and any other details.
- [ ] You have read and understand the terms of the project's license, and freely provide the photographs for use in the project.
